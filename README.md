✅: GPU + software support
❌: GPU not support

*Note 1: Intel Macs support HEVC Rext software decoding of 8 ~ 12b 400, 420, 422, 444 contents. Apple Silicon Mac supports HEVC Rext hardware decoding of 8 ~ 10b 400, 420, 422, 444 contents, and software decoding of 12b 400, 420, 422, 444 contents on macOS 13+.*

*Note 2: Intel Gen10 GPUs support HEVC Rext hardware decoding of 8b 420, 8b 422, 8b 444, 10b 420, 10b 422, 10b 444 contents on Windows. Gen11+ GPUs additionally support HEVC Rext hardware decoding of 12b 420, 12b 422, 12b 444 contents.*

*Note 3: Although NVIDIA GPUs support HEVC Rext hardware decoding of 8 ~ 12b non-422 contents via CUVID or NVDEC, but because they did not provide a D3D11 interface, thus Chromium will not support it in the future.*

*Note 4: HEVC 8b 444, 12b 422, 12b 444 support requires Chrome >= `117.0.5866.0`.*

*Note 5: HEVC 8b 422 support requires Chrome >= `118.0.5956.0`.*

*Note 6: To retain the original 4:2:2/4:4:4 chroma sampling, requires Chrome >= `125.0.6408.0`.*

## What's the hardware encoding supported HEVC profile?

HEVC Main (macOS & Windows & Android, macOS up to the hardware<sup>[4]</sup>, Windows up to the hardware<sup>[3]</sup>, Android up to the hardware)

*Note 1: Chrome >= `130.0.6703.0` no need any switch. Chrome < `130.0.6703.0` need to pass a chrome switch to enable it (`--enable-features=PlatformHEVCEncoderSupport`)[Test Page](https://w3c.github.io/webcodecs/samples/encode-decode-worker/index.html).*

*Note 2: Windows / Mac need to make sure Chrome version >= `109.0.5397.0`, Android need to make sure Chrome version >= `117.0.5899.0`.*

*Note 3: Chrome >= `131.0.6759.0` on Windows no longer have the hardcode resolution and framerate limit, it will call MediaFoundation to calculate a resolution and framerate combination based on hardware, resolution up to `7680x4320` and framerate up to `300fps`. Chrome < `130.0.6703.0` on Windows, the max resolution is a hardcode value of `1920x1088 & 30fps`.*

*Note 4: If Chrome >= `131.0.6771.0` and Mac has Apple Silicon chips, the max HEVC resolution can support up to `8192x4352 & 120fps`. Otherwise the max resolution up to `4096x2304 & 120fps`.*

On Windows platform, Chrome supports PQ, HDR10 (PQ with static metadata), and HLG. Automatic Tone-mapping will be enabled based on static metadata (if present). HDR10+ SEI dynamic metadata wil be ignored while decoding and playback will downgrade to HDR10.

On macOS platform, Chrome supports PQ, HDR10 (PQ with static metadata), HLG. In SDR / HDR / Hybrid mode, the macOS system will automatically perform EDR to ensure that HDR is displayed correctly. Chrome / Edge shared the same code thus has the same decoding ability, Safari also supports the above all HDR formats.

*Note 1: Firefox >= 133 enables HEVC decoding support by default (Windows platform only). It also supports HEVC Main and Main10 profile (HDR contents usually encoded with Main10 profile), but doesn't seems able to render HLG/PQ correctly.*

#### Dolby Vision Supports Status

There are two type of support type here:
1. Type 1: Supports RPU dynamic metadata and Profile 5 (IPTPQc2).
2. Type 2: Supports profiles like Profile 8/9 that has cross-compatible HDR10/HLG/SDR support.

For the first type, currently only Chromecast and Windows platforms have very limited support. On Windows platform, Chrome supports encrypted Dolby Vision content, for versions of Chrome >= 110, when manually passing `--enable-features=PlatformEncryptedDolbyVision` switch and launch Chrome and when the system has installed the Dolby Vision extension and HEVC video extension, Profile 4/5/8 will be supported, "Supported" will be returned when querying the API (Note: For external HDR displays, if HDR mode is turned on, Microsoft's MediaFoundation has a bug and will not return "Supported" results).

For the second type, Profile 8/9 with cross-compatibility such as HLG, HDR10, SDR, using API to query with `dvh1`, `dvhe`, `dva1`, `dvav` will return "not supported" (for example :`MediaSource.isTypeSupported('video/mp4;codecs="dvh1.08.07"')`), while when querying with `hvc1`, `hev1`, `avc1`, `avc3`, "supported" will be returned. The specific version of Chrome has different implementation details:

Chrome >= 122. as long as the platform supports HEVC, then it is supported. Assuming that the API used by developers is MSE, the logic will be something like below:

```javascript
if (isTypeSupported('video/mp4;codecs="dvh1.08.07"')) {
   if (use_rpu) {
     // Playback should success. Chrome internally considers the codec to be Dolby Vision 
     // and uses RPU dynamic metadata.
     source.addSourceBuffer('video/mp4;codecs="dvh1.08.07"');
     ...
   } else if (dvcc.dv_bl_signal_compatibility_id === 1 ||
              dvcc.dv_bl_signal_compatibility_id === 2 ||
              dvcc.dv_bl_signal_compatibility_id === 4) {
     // Playback should success. Chrome internally considers the codec to be HEVC,
     // ignores RPU dynamic metadata, decode and render in HLG/HDR10/SDR mode.
     // Note: If it is profile 5, source buffer can only be created with `dvh1` or `dvhe`
     // mimetype.
     source.addSourceBuffer('video/mp4;codecs="hev1.2.4.L120.90"');
     ...
   } else {
     // Playback should fails, for incompatible dolby profiles, if you use HEVC construct
     // source buffer, it will always fails.
   }
} else if (isTypeSupported('video/mp4;codecs="hev1.2.4.L120.90"')) {
   if (dvcc.dv_bl_signal_compatibility_id === 1 ||
       dvcc.dv_bl_signal_compatibility_id === 2 ||
       dvcc.dv_bl_signal_compatibility_id === 4) {
     // Playback should success. Chrome internally considers the codec to be HEVC,
     // ignores RPU dynamic metadata, decode and render in HLG/HDR10/SDR mode.
     source.addSourceBuffer('video/mp4;codecs="hev1.2.4.L120.90"');
     ...
   } else {
     // Playback should fails, for example when Chrome does not support profile 5 but you use 
     // HEVC construct SourceBuffer.
   }
} else {
   // Playback should fails, HEVC is not supported.
}
```

Versions 110 ~ 121 of Chrome on Windows, Dolby Vision is not playable at all if its not encrypted, this is a bug of the browser. Chrome on other platforms, such as macOS, Android, etc, as long as constructing source buffer with `hvc1`, `hev1`, `avc1`, `avc3` and the sample entry is not `dvh1`, `dvhe`, `dva1`, `dvav`, then the playback should be success.

Versions 107 ~ 109 of Chrome, if constructing source buffer with `hvc1`, `hev1`, `avc1`, `avc3` and the sample entry is not `dvh1`, `dvhe`, `dva1`, `dvav`, then the playback should be success.

#### HDR support by version of Chrome/Edge

Chrome 107 does not support the ability to extract HEVC static metadata, and all HDR10 video playback are downgraded to PQ only mode. HLG videos uses the video processor API provided by the GPU vendor for processing tone-mapping has a poor performance on some laptops, and playing 4K video may cause frame dropping.

Chrome 108 supports the ability to extract HEVC static metadata. For videos with static metadata written in the container, the playback is okay on 108, but some videos are not written static metadata to their containers, thus Chrome 108 can not extract the static metadata from these videos which causing the playback to be downgraded to PQ only mode, and the max content light level maybe cut to a low value for these videos. In addition, the HLG Tone-mapping algorithm on Windows platform has been switched to Chrome's own algorithm, which solves the problem of bad performance on the laptop when using video processor for HLG Tone-mapping. However, Chrome has been using 8 bit for Tone-mapping, which resulting an insufficient contrast ratio of the Tone-mapping result.

Chrome 109 makes the HDR -> SDR process to a 16 bit + zero copy process, which improves the accuracy of PQ Tone-mapping on Windows platform, thus the problem of the insufficient contrast ratio for HLG has been also solved, and the video memory usage has been reduced by about 50%.

Chrome 110 solves the problem of incomplete static metadata extraction. It supports the extraction of static metadata from both the bitstream and the container, thus the max content light level issue has been solved, and at this point all HDR issues should have been resolved.

Chrome 119 fixed 10bit video playback issues for AMD GPU on Windows platform (black screen when playing HLG video in SDR mode, 4K freezes, high memory usage, color change when switching full-screen, crash when playing SDR video in HDR mode).

Chrome 122 improved Dolby Vision cross-compatible playback ability.

Chrome 123 ensures that on Windows platforms, PQ/HDR10 video can be rendered at absolute brightness when system HDR mode is enabled. It also solves the problem of abnormal Tone-mapping issue when the window is dragged between SDR monitor / HDR monitor when multiple monitors are connected.

Chrome 124 solves the issue that on Windows platform when the NVIDIA RTX Auto HDR feature is enabled, page scrolling will cause video brightness transition.

Chrome 125 solves all issues with Intel HDR10 MPO, the feature has been re-enabled.

Edge 125 solves the issue of no zero-copy output when using `VDAVideoDecoder` decodes HEVC Main10 10bit contents on the Windows platform, and the issue of PQ/HDR10/HLG bad tone-mapping result could also be solved. The HDR rendering results of later versions of Edge are expected to be exactly the same as Chrome, performed by Skia, and the rendering results of various GPU manufacturers will remain consistent no matter system HDR mode on or off (Intel HDR10 MPO may be enabled if system HDR mode is turned on and GPU generation >= 11, which may result in slight inconsistencies with Skia rendering results).

}
```

*Note 1：The above four API have already took `--disable-gpu`, `--disable-accelerated-video-decode`, `gpu-workaround`, `settings - system - Use hardware acceleration when available`, `OS version` etc... into consideration, and if Chrome version >= `107.0.5304.0` (There is a bug in Chrome 108 and previous versions on Windows platform. If a specific GPU driver version causes D3D11VideoDecoder to be disabled for some reason, although the hardware decoding is no longer available, APIs such as isTypeSupported may still return "support", the bug has been fixed in Chrome 109) and OS is macOS or Windows, the result are guaranteed.*

*Note 2: There is a bug for the Android platform, Chrome < `112.0.5612.0` does not return the actual support status of different devices (although Android >= 5.0 supports HEVC main profile SW decoding by default, however whether main10 profile is supported or not completely depends on hardware), and always assume that all HEVC profiles and resolution are supported. Chrome >= `112.0.5612.0` now solves this bug, and will return the correct result depends on hardware and the given video's resolution. Just like Windows and macOS, the above three APIs are supported as well, and every influencing factors should have been taken into account.*

*Note 3：Compared with `MediaSource.isTypeSupported()` or `CanPlayType()`, we recommend using `MediaCapabilities`, since `MediaCapabilities` not only takes `settings - system - Use hardware acceleration when available` etc... into consideration, but also check if the given `width and height` is supported or not since different GPU may have different max resolution support, eg: some AMD GPU only support up to 4096 * 2048, and some old GPU only support up to 1080P.*

## What's the hardware decoding tech diff? (Compared with Edge / Safari / Firefox)

#### Windows

Edge uses `VDAVideoDecoder` to call `MFT` (need to install `HEVC Video Extension`, Edge 117 ~ 121 uses `MediaFoundationRenderer`, and switch back to the original `VDAVideoDecoder` after version 122) to finish the HEVC decoding which is the same tech behind `Movies and TV` builtin system app.

Firefox (>= 133) uses `MFT` (need to install `HEVC Video Extension`) to finish the HEVC decoding which is the same tech behind `Movies and TV` builtin system app.

When using `MFT`, If the device does not have hardware decoding support of a specific profile (i.e. NVIDIA GTX 745 does not support Main10 profile) or resolution (i.e. NVIDIA GTX 960 does not support resolutions above 4K), `MFT` will automatically switch to software decoding.

Chrome uses `D3D11VideoDecoder` to call `D3D11VA` (no need to install anything) to finish the HEVC HW decoding which is the same tech behind video players like `VLC`.

#### macOS

Edge and Chrome use the same decoding implementations on macOS.

Safari and Chrome use the same `VideoToolbox` to finish the HEVC decoding, if the device does not have hardware support, it will automatically fallback to use software decoding. Compared with Safari, Chrome requires higher OS version (10.13 vs 11.0).

## How to verify HEVC hardware decoding support is enabled?

1. Open `chrome://gpu`, and search `Video Acceleration Information`, you should see **Decode hevc main** field, **Decode hevc main 10** field, and **Decode hevc main still-picture** field (macOS and indows Intel Gen10+ iGPU will show **Decode hevc range extensions** as well) present if hardware decoding is supported (macOS is an exception here, you see this field doesn't means the decode will use hardware, it actually depends on your GPU).
2. Open `chrome://media-internals` and play some HEVC video ([Test Page](https://lf-tk-sg.ibytedtos.com/obj/tcs-client-sg/resources/video_demo_hevc.html)) if the decoder is `VDAVideoDecoder` or `VideoToolboxVideoDecoder` or `D3D11VideoDecoder` or `VaapiVideoDecoder` that means the video is using hardware decoding (macOS is an exception here, if the OS >= Big Sur, and the GPU doesn't support HEVC, VideoToolbox will fallback to software decode which has a better performance compared with FFMPEG, the decoder is `VDAVideoDecoder` or `VideoToolboxVideoDecoder` in this case indeed), and if the decoder is `FFMpegVideoDecoder` that means the video is using software decoding.
3. Open `Activity Monitor` on Mac and search `VTDecoderXPCService`, if the cpu usage larger than 0 when playing video, that means hardware (or software) decoding is being used.
4. Open `Windows Task Manager` on Windows and switch to `Performance` - `GPU`, if `Video Decode`(Intel, NVIDIA) or `Video Codec`(AMD) usage larger than 0 when playing video, that means hardware decoding is being used. For some first generation GPU (i.e: NVIDIA RTX 745) that support HEVC, since there is no dedicated hw decoding circuit inside the GPU, although the `D3D11` decoding API is supported, it will only occupy the general `3D` utilization when decoding.

## How to verify HEVC hardware encoding support is enabled?

1. Open `chrome://gpu`, and search `Video Acceleration Information`, you should see **Encode hevc main** field present if hardware encoding is supported (macOS is an exception here, you see this field doesn't means the decode will use hardware, it actually depends on your GPU).
2. Open `Activity Monitor` and encode some HEVC video on Mac and search `VTEncoderXPCService`, if the cpu usage larger than 0 when encoding video, that means hardware encoding is being used.
3. Open `Windows Task Manager` and encode some HEVC video on Windows and switch to `Performance` - `GPU`, if `Video Encode`(Intel, NVIDIA) or `Video Codec`(AMD) usage larger than 0 when encoding video, that means hardware encoding is being used.

## Why my GPU support HEVC, but still not able to hardware decode?

#### OS version is too low

##### Windows

Please make sure you are using Windows 8 and above, this is because the `D3D11VideoDecoder` doesn't support Windows 7.

##### macOS

Please make sure you are using macOS Big Sur and above, this is because `CMVideoFormatDescriptionCreateFromHEVCParameterSets` API has compatibility issue on lower macOS.

#### GPU driver has bug

Some GPU driver may has bug which will cause `D3D11VideoDecoder` forbidden to use. in this case, you need to upgrade your GPU driver and try again. [See reference](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:gpu/config/gpu_driver_bug_list.json?q=disable_d3d11_video_decoder)

#### GPU hardware has bug

Some GPU hardware may has bug which will cause `D3D11VideoDecoder` forbidden to use. in this case, we can't do anything else but to use the FFMPEG software decode. [See reference](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:gpu/config/gpu_driver_bug_list.json?q=disable_d3d11_video_decoder)

## How to Build?

1. Follow [the official build doc](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code/) to prepare the build environment then fetch the source code from `main` branch (HEVC HW codes has been merged).
2. (Optional) To enable HEVC software decoding: switch to `src/third_party/ffmpeg` dir, then execute `git am /path/to/add-hevc-ffmpeg-decoder-parser.patch`. If failed to apply the patch, could also try `node /path/to/add-hevc-ffmpeg-decoder-parser.js` to enable software decoding (Node.js is required to run the script), then execute `git am /path/to/change-libavcodec-header.patch` manually (this may still fail if the upstream got updated but this repo doesn't sync the code in time, you could submit an issue or patch to report or fix this), finally switch to `src` dir, and execute `git am /path/to/enable-hevc-ffmpeg-decoding.patch`.
3. (Optional) To enable HEVC WebRTC support by default, switch to `src` dir, then execute `git am /path/to/enable-hevc-webrtc-send-receive-by-default.patch`, and then switch to `src/third_party/webrtc` dir, execute `git am /path/to/enable-h26x-packet-buffer-by-default.patch`.
4. (Optional) To enable HEVC MediaRecorder support by default, switch to `src` dir, then execute `git am /path/to/enable-hevc-media-recorder-support.patch`.
5. (Optional) To integrate Widevine CDM to support EME API (like Netflix): switch to `src` dir, then execute `cp -R /path/to/widevine/* third_party/widevine/cdm` (Windows: `xcopy /path/to/widevine third_party\widevine\cdm /E/H`).
6. If you are using `Mac` + want to build `x64` arch (target_cpu to `x86` , `arm64` , `arm` also available) + want to add CDM support, then run `gn gen out/Release64 --args="is_component_build = false is_official_build = true is_debug = false ffmpeg_branding = \"Chrome\" target_cpu = \"x64\" proprietary_codecs = true media_use_ffmpeg = true enable_widevine = true bundle_widevine_cdm = true"`, if you are using `Windows`, you need to add `enable_media_foundation_widevine_cdm = true` as well.
7. Run `autoninja -C out/Release64 chrome` to start the build.
8. Open Chromium directly.

## How to integrate this into Chromium based project like Electron?

If Electron >= v22.0.0, the HEVC HW decoding feature for macOS, Windows, and Linux (VAAPI only) should have already been integrated. To add HEVC SW decoding, the method should be the same with Chromium guide above.

If Electron >= v33.0.0, the HEVC HW encoding feature for macOS, Windows should have already been integrated.
